# Semester project for course PV193, Faculty of Informatics, Masaryk University
   
- Bech32m encoding
- Test vectors are in the file `testvectors.txt` in Pythonic format.
- ~Remember to sign your commits. Prefer GPG..~
- ~No use strucurising test vectors as JSON since there exists no JSON parser in standard library. Will right a few tests using the `serde_json` binary but someone will have to replace that subsequently.~

## To Do:
   - Write all the tests.
   - Get all the tests to pass locally.
   - Get the tests to pass in github.
   - Get the tests running on other branches.
   - Refactor the tests to be in a separate file.
   - (Hardocde the test vectors in the code)
   - Test Encoding
   - Implement Decoding
   - Test Decoding
   - Implement Error Correction.
   - Test Error Correction.
   - Decide on User interface.
   - Implement User interface.
   - Make test vectors for user interface.
   - Test user interface.
   - Analyze the various attack vectors.
   - Address the various attack vectors.
   - Prepare the presentation.
   - Record the presentation.
